# CONTRIBUTING TO DNSaaFS

First off: thank you for even considering contributing to this absurd, possibly misunderstood, probably underappreciated project.

If you're here to help make it weirder, tighter, sharper, more encrypted, or more elegant. Welcome!

## 🧠 Ground Rules

- **No Corporate Co-opting**: If you work for a company that makes money off open source but gives nothing back, turn around. This isn’t for you, this is not a product, should never become one, and you're insane if you think people will pay to use the world's slowest and most unstable file-system.
- **No Narc Energy**: If your first instinct is to open a pull request fixing a swear word or making it “more professional,” step away from the keyboard. Go watch some George Carlin or soemthing.
- **Code > Vibes**: Contributions must *run*. Ideology is welcome, but perpetually failing tests are not.

## ✅ Things You *Can* Do

- Submit useful bugfixes, features, or improvements
- Improve DNS resilience, async logic, or encryption hygiene
- Add docs that actually help the next freak to use this
- Add cursed corner-case tests
- Passionate about something else related, make a suggestion!

## ❌ Things You *Can’t* Do

- Suggest replacing Argon2 or AES-GCM with whatever you saw in a Medium post
- Rewrite the license or remove the humor
- Pitch this to VCs
- “Normalize” the README for corporate consumption alignment

## 💀 Violating the Spirit

If you commercialize this without negotiating a license, we’ve got a special set of clauses just for you.  
It’s called `TERMS_OF_HUMILIATION.md`. 

If you’re cool, thoughtful, and aligned—your contributions will be respected.  
If you’re a leech, grifter, or ethics-vacuumed replicant—prepare to be remembered.

Thanks. Now go encrypt something beautiful.
