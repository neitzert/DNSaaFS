# ü§™ DNSFS Testing Suite  
_AKA: The Department of Distributed Sabotage Prevention_

Welcome to `tests/`, the digital proving ground where we find out just how badly you can screw up a DNS-based filesystem before it breaks. Spoiler: it‚Äôs surprisingly resilient ‚Äî unless you sneeze near a recursive resolver.

## What's In Here?

- **`DNSFS_blocktest.py`**  
  Hurts a single block repeatedly. It deserves it. Writes, reads, overwrites, deletes. If it fails, you‚Äôll know. The test won't.

- **`DNSFS_blockreadtest.py`**  
  Attempts to read what should exist. If it doesn‚Äôt, one of you lied. The script is not interested in who.

- **`mountDNSFS.py`**  
  Mounts the whole damn thing. If your DNS zone cries, logs it. If your DNS server dies, logs that too. You‚Äôll still be at fault, of course.

## How to Run the Tests

You'll need:
- Python 3.12+
- `fusepy`, `dnspython`, `cryptography`, `argon2-cffi`, `tqdm`
- A functioning will to debug low-level DNS I/O failures

```bash
# Make sure you're not mounted ‚Äî emotionally or otherwise
sudo umount /tmp/dnsfs || true

# Then:
python3 DNSFS_blocktest.py
python3 DNSFS_blockreadtest.py
```

If these pass, you probably forgot to test something important.

## When It Fails

1. **Check the logs**: `dnsfs.log` knows all.  
2. **Blame someone else**: start with your DNS provider.  
3. **Drink something calming**: you mounted a filesystem over DNS, after all.

## Contributing Tests

If you want to write a new test, go ahead. Just remember:
- If it doesn't fail in absurd edge cases, it's not done.
- If it doesn't produce existential doubt in the user, it's not complete.
- If it passes every time, you probably hardcoded the answer.
