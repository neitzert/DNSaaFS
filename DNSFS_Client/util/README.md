Got it — you're setting the tone for the `utils/` directory. Here's a tailored `README.md` for that folder, matching the vibe, style, and irreverent clarity of the others:

# 🧰 `utils/` — Tools You Probably Shouldn’t Run

Welcome to the digital drawer labeled "miscellaneous crap I might need." This folder exists purely to house small, questionable shell scripts and Python things that seemed like a good idea at the time.

## What's in the box?

- **`makekey.sh`**  
  Uses `dnssec-keygen` to generate a TSIG key. You probably only need it once. You’ll definitely forget what it does three weeks later.  
  _Note: Running this will not summon demons, but it comes close._

- **`License.md`**  
  A legal document that is technically enforceable but mostly written in the tone of someone who’s been bitten by licensing lawyers and now bites back.

## How to Use

You don’t.  
Just kidding — if you’re here, you’re already too far gone.

```bash
./makekey.sh myzone.lan
```

This will generate some files, possibly your doom, and definitely a key named something like `Kmyzone.lan.+157+XXXX.key`.

## Why does this exist?

Because DNSFS is already insane, and keeping the insanity modular seemed like the humane thing to do.

## LICENSE

This folder is subject to the same licensing terms as the rest of the project:

Also known as the **“Try Me and Die”** license.  
See `License.md` if you enjoy pain or are a startup founder.

_“Just because you can write a utility script doesn’t mean you should. But here we are.”_

Let me know if you want to throw a `TERMS_OF_CONFUSION` file in here too.
